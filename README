Due to many requests I share my zsh configuration compilation.
Copy the repository to ~/.zsh and run 'make install' once
(or link the ~/.config/zsh/zshrc manually to ~/.zshrc)

### File description
$ZSH_CONFIG/README      - This file
$ZSH_CONFIG/Makefile    - make-config to run with 'make install'
$ZSH_CONFIG/aliases     - alias definitions which can be edited/modified with 'aedit'
$ZSH_CONFIG/completion  - tab completion configuration
$ZSH_CONFIG/functions   - functions and key bindings to that functions
$ZSH_CONFIG/options     - shell options as history size, general keyindings, etc
$ZSH_CONFIG/prompt      - the prompt definition
$ZSH_CONFIG/zshrc       - the main RC file (will be linked to ~/.zshrc)

### These files are not in the repository but will be created
$ZSH_CACHE/history     - the history file (shared for all zsh instances)
